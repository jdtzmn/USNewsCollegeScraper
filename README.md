# U.S. News College Scaper

This was a quick script that I wrote in order to make getting stats from USNews easier. These stats included: full college name, number of undergraduate students, gender ratio, and acceptance rate.

## Get Started

This is a node.js script, which means it requires that `node` be installed in order to run.

### Usage

```bash
$ npm start
# ? What college do you want info on? (Use arrow keys or type to search)
# No results...
```

Once you are done entering the colleges you want, the script will scrape data such as undergraduate count, gender ratio, full school name, and acceptance rate.
